# Interactive structural visualizations of complete mapping of mutations to the RBD that reduce binding by polyclonal sera from mice vaccinated with a mosaic-8 or homotypic Beta variant RBD vaccine

Below are links to interactive visualizations of the effects of single mutations to the Beta (B.1.351) SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) on binding by plasmas from Beta mosaic-8 or Beta homotypic RBD-vaccinated mice.

These visualizations are built using [dms-view](https://dms-view.github.io/docs/).
These experiments are described in **add link**, and raw data are available [here](https://github.com/jbloomlab/SARS-CoV-2-RBD_Beta_mosaic_np_vaccine/blob/main/results/supp_data/B1351_raw_data.csv).
This vaccine was first described in [Cohen, et al (2021)](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abf6840).

Sites where mutations reduce binding are shown for each serum, and are mapped to the ACE2-bound Wuhan-Hu-1 RBD structure ([PDB 6M0J](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6M0J)) or to the RBD of the B.1.351 variant ([PDB 7LYQ](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/7LYQ)).
