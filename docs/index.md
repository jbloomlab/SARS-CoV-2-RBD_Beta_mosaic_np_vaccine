# Interactive structural visualizations of complete mapping of mutations to the RBD that reduce binding by polyclonal sera from mice vaccinated with a mosaic-8 or homotypic Beta variant RBD vaccine

Below are links to interactive visualizations of the effects of single mutations to the Beta (B.1.351) SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) on binding by plasmas from mosaic-8b RBD-mi3-vaccinated mice, SARS2 Beta homotypic RBD-mi3-vaccinated mice, or mosaic-8b RBD-mi3-vaccinated NHPs.

These visualizations are built using [dms-view](https://dms-view.github.io/docs/).
These experiments are described in **add link**, and raw data are available [here](https://github.com/jbloomlab/SARS-CoV-2-RBD_Beta_mosaic_np_vaccine/blob/main/results/supp_data/all_raw_data.csv).
This vaccine was first described in [Cohen, et al (2021)](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abf6840).

Sites where mutations reduce binding are shown for each serum, and are mapped to the ACE2-bound Beta RBD, made by aligning [PDB 6M0J](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6M0J) and [PDB 7LYQ](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/7LYQ) or to the RBD of the Beta variant.
